# sales-report

In this Power BI report, I cleaned the data in the query editor and harnessed DAX mathematical formulas to create calculated columns and measures. The report provides a comprehensive view of the budget, sales, and variances, allowing for comparisons across different time frames, customers, and product categories through the DAX expressions I developed. The data is presented visually using a variety of charts to facilitate clear insights.
